# 📦 Phase 2 Summary: Scaffolding & Boilerplate Setup

## 🎯 Objective

Lay the foundation for the Budget Tracker app by setting up its folder structure, development tools, and baseline functionality using modern technologies like React, Vite, Electron, and SQLite.

---

## ✅ Accomplishments

### 🏗 Folder & File Scaffolding

- Created full file structure based on SDLC planning and flow documentation
- Organized by `/src/components`, `/src/pages`, `/src/db`, `/src/styles`, and `/electron`

> **📎 Note:** The originally planned `/src/db/` folder was replaced during Phase 3 with a centralized `/ipc/` structure.  
> All database-related logic (`schema.js`, `dbHandlers.js`, `db.js`) now lives in `/ipc/` to align with our contextBridge-secure, backend-only access strategy.  
> This improves modularity, enforces security, and reflects our final architectural direction.

### ⚙️ Tooling & Stack Setup

- Initialized project with `Vite` for fast React development
- Integrated `Electron` for cross-platform desktop app support
- Defined valid `package.json` and `vite.config.js` to power both dev and Electron modes
- Set up `.gitignore` and README for repository hygiene

### 💡 Boilerplate Content

- Added placeholder files for all core UI pages:
  - Dashboard, Expenses, Income, Misc, Budget, Settings, Sign-In
- Basic `App.jsx` and `main.jsx` wiring complete
- Dark mode and theme support stubbed in
- Navigation and layout components scaffolded

### 🧪 Local Dev Verified

- App successfully boots and displays placeholder landing message
- React + Vite + Electron integration confirmed operational

---

## 🗃 Files Added

- `electron.cjs`, `preload.js`: Main & preload process for Electron
- `src/main.jsx`, `src/App.jsx`: Entry point and core wrapper
- `src/pages/`: Placeholder components for all routes
- `src/styles/`: Modular CSS layout support
- `src/db/`: Placeholder for schema and database access
- `public/index.html`: Proper HTML mount point

---

## 🧭 Next Steps

**Phase 3: Core Feature Implementation**  
Start with `FLOW01`: Create New Month — set up the DB, UI form, and logic for beginning each monthly budget cycle.

---

## 📁 Repo Organization

- All flow documentation stored in `.docs/`
- GitHub repo initialized and actively versioned
- All assets modular and ready for iteration

---

📌 _Phase 2 established the scaffolding for a maintainable, modular, and scalable financial tracking application._
