# üóëÔ∏è Flow 10: Delete Month

## üß† Goal

Allow users to permanently delete an entire month of financial data (expenses, income, misc transactions) if it was created in error or is no longer needed.

---

## üîÑ Flow Breakdown

### 1. Trigger

- User selects a month from a dropdown or calendar
- Clicks ‚ÄúDelete Month‚Äù button/icon
- A confirmation modal appears with warning text:

> ‚ÄúThis will permanently delete **all data** for [Month Name]. This cannot be undone.‚Äù

---

### 2. Validation

- User must confirm the action (e.g., click ‚ÄúYes, Delete‚Äù or type the month name)
- App checks that the month exists

---

### 3. DB Write

Delete from all affected tables using the `monthId`:

```ts
await db.expenses.where("monthId").equals(monthId).delete();
await db.income.where("monthId").equals(monthId).delete();
await db.misc.where("monthId").equals(monthId).delete();
await db.months.delete(monthId);
```

---

### 4. UI Update

- Remove deleted month from month selector
- Redirect to another available month (preferably most recent)
- Refresh dashboard and all affected lists
- Show a toast confirming deletion
